# WP-Wrapper
API Wrapper for Wordpress JSON API (.Net 3.5)
 

## About project ##
We at Entropy Developments built this project for prototype testing with a video game we made using unity3d. This library was used as a login method. We do have to warn everyone that it is (as of v1.0.0.0) highly experimental we might continue developing it and we might not.
